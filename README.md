# Snake with Python
**Author** : Tony De Corso (Italy, 22)
# Introduction
This project has the goal to build in time a fun version of the snake game using Python. In particular, 
the games exploits the **pygame** module.  
The game can be launched by executing the **main.py** script, which needs all of the other scripts in the repository, so make sure you run it in the same directory of all the other scripts, otherwise it will not work!  
Right now the game is just in its early stages, so please follow the project to enjoy all of its functionalities that will be released in future.  
In order to play, all you need to do is use the arrows to move the snake. You die if you hit the walls or if you hit yourself!  
Have fun!
